The Firebase SDK may throw an error if you try to access a property of a document snapshot before the snapshot has been fully populated. This can happen if you're using asynchronous operations and trying to access the data too early.  For example:

```javascript
db.collection('users').doc('someId').get().then(doc => {
  console.log(doc.data().name); // Error if data() is not yet populated
});
```

This often manifests as `TypeError: Cannot read properties of undefined (reading 'name')` or similar errors.
